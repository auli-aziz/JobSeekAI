Companies spend an enormous amount of time and resources patching and fortifying open source software in order to ship with confidence &amp; compliance. </p>\n<p>Founded by the industry's leading experts on open source software, security and cloud native development, Chainguard has built the largest library of open source software that is secure by default. Customers including Snowflake, Canva, and HPE rely on Chainguard to build securely with open source software across the organization.</p>\n<p>Chainguard is the safe source for open source.</p>\n<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>\n<p><span style='\"font-weight:'>We live and breathe our company values:</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>We are customer obsessed</em></strong><span style='\"font-weight:'> - Our true advantage is the strength of our relationships with customers through collaboration, empathy, and responsiveness.  We establish trust as we educate, advocate, and listen to their needs.  Our focus is on delivering solutions to our customers that create value and make their lives better. </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>We have a bias for intentional action</em></strong><span style='\"font-weight:'> - We’re a start-up and we need to move fast. However we need to move fast through intentional action to make sure we’re able to deliver quickly and efficiently on what is most impactful to our collective success.  We prioritize, plan, try things, and fail fast.  We think about how what we do impacts other teams and communicate our progress - owning the whole solution from start to finish. If we move fast enough, we can make two or three mistakes, learn, and correct them before competitors even make their first decision.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>We don’t take ourselves too seriously (but we do serious work)</em></strong><span style='\"font-weight:'> - Though we are solving an important problem which takes focus and a degree of seriousness, we don’t take ourselves too seriously while we do.  We laugh, have fun, embrace uniqueness, and enjoy the journey. Together.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>We trust each other and assume good intentions</em></strong><span style='\"font-weight:'> - We hire great team members and trust them to do their work. We’re transparent with data, news, and decisions - positive or negative - to empower team members to make well informed decisions. Showing up for each other fully means we celebrate each other’s accomplishments as well as give compassionate direct feedback when needed.  We always default to assuming good intentions.</span></p></div><p><strong>The role, in a nutshell:</strong></p>\n<p>We are seeking a highly motivated, energetic, and results-driven Business Development Representative (BDR) to join our team.
